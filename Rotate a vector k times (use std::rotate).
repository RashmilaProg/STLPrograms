The std::rotate algorithm in C++ STL can be used to rotate a vector k times. It takes three iterators as arguments: first, middle, and last. The elements in the range [first, middle) are moved to the end of the range [first, last), and the elements in the range [middle, last) are moved to the beginning of the range [first, last).
Rotating a vector k times to the left:
To rotate a vector v to the left by k positions, the middle iterator should point to the element that will become the new first element. This element is at v.begin() + k.
C++

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    int k = 2; // Rotate by 2 positions to the left

    // Ensure k is within the bounds of the vector size
    k %= v.size(); 

    std::rotate(v.begin(), v.begin() + k, v.end());

    for (int x : v) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl; // Output: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 

    return 0;
}
Rotating a vector k times to the right:
To rotate a vector v to the right by k positions, the middle iterator should point to the element that is k positions from the end of the vector. This element is at v.begin() + (v.size() - k).
C++

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    int k = 2; // Rotate by 2 positions to the right

    // Ensure k is within the bounds of the vector size
    k %= v.size(); 

    std::rotate(v.begin(), v.begin() + (v.size() - k), v.end());

    for (int x : v) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl; // Output: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5

    return 0;
}
Using reverse iterators for right rotation (alternative):
Another approach for right rotation is to use reverse iterators with std::rotate. This conceptually treats the right end as the "beginning" for rotation.
C++

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    int k = 2; // Rotate by 2 positions to the right

    // Ensure k is within the bounds of the vector size
    k %= v.size(); 

    std::rotate(v.rbegin(), v.rbegin() + k, v.rend());

    for (int x : v) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl; // Output: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5

    return 0;
}
In all cases, k %= v.size() is used to handle cases where k is greater than or equal to the vector's size, effectively reducing k to the equivalent number of rotations within a single cycle.
